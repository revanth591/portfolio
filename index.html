            <h4>SOLVED REAL WORLD PROBLEM / CONCEPTUAL TASK</h4>
            <p>Real-World Problem:

                Overbooking and seat allocation inefficiency: In traditional cinema halls, people sometimes face issues like overbooking or poorly managed seat allocations, 
                where customers end up with suboptimal seating arrangements or even lose out on their booking due to mismanagement.
            </p>
                <p>Conceptual Task:
                
                Build a dynamic seat allocation and real-time ticket booking system: Develop a system where customers can view the available seats in real-time, select their preferred seats, and complete the booking process with confidence. 
                The system should also automatically update seat availability when a ticket is booked, preventing overbooking and ensuring accurate seat allocation.</p>

            <h4>NPTEL/HOTS QUESTIONS SOLUTION</h4>
            <p>Traffic Congestion in Urban Areas
                Problem Statement:
                
                Urban areas are facing severe traffic congestion, leading to increased air pollution, longer commute times, and reduced productivity.
            </p>
               <p>
                Solution:
                
                    Smart Traffic Management: Implement AI-driven traffic light systems that adjust based on real-time traffic data.
                    Promote Public Transportation: Develop integrated public transport systems with real-time tracking and accessibility features.
                    Encourage Carpooling: Create incentives for carpooling through ride-sharing apps and dedicated carpool lanes.
                    Implement Congestion Pricing: Charge fees for driving in highly congested zones to reduce traffic volume..</p>
